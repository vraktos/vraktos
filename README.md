- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Matias Demonte. I'm a Junior Web Developer looking for specialization in Back End. I finished Henry's boot-camp and now I'm ready to begin this new journey of development and prove myself! I'm looking for an environment where I can learn lots and grow both as a person and as a professional.
